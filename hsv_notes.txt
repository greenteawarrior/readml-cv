An HSV ranges for identification of waffles:
Dennis and I used [0,50,50] to [70,255,255] first.
Based on experimentation today,
[10, 20, 20] to [35, 255, 255] seems alright.

H is the biggest determiner.
~0 red
~15-30 orange, brown, yellow
~60-70 green
~100 blue
then magentas, purples etc.  up to 180.
In the "changing colorspaces" tutorial, it goes through it and gives video capture HSV filtering code to play around with filters.

Keep in mind when looking up HSV ranges that the H is scaled to [0,179] from [0,360).
